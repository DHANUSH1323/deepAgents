🧠 deepAgents

deepAgents is a from-scratch exploration of stateful, graph-based AI agents built using LangGraph + LangChain, with a strong focus on how agents actually work internally.

Instead of hiding complexity behind abstractions, this repo makes agent state, planning, memory, and execution explicit and inspectable.

If you want to understand what really happens inside an agent loop, this repo is for you.

🚀 Why this repo exists

Most “agent” examples online:
	•	hide state mutations
	•	blur steps into a single black-box loop
	•	rely on magic wrappers

deepAgents takes the opposite approach.

This repo is about:
	•	explicit agent state
	•	graph nodes as execution steps
	•	reducers for safe state merging
	•	task planning via TODOs
	•	virtual file systems inside agent memory
	•	tool-driven state updates
	•	sub-agents and composition

In short: agents as engineered systems, not demos.

🧩 What you’ll learn from this repo

1️⃣ Agent state, done properly

You’ll see how to extend LangGraph’s AgentState to include:
	•	structured TODO lists
	•	long-lived virtual files
	•	safe merging via reducers

This enables long-running, recoverable agents.

⸻

2️⃣ Task planning with TODOs

Agents don’t just “respond”. They:
	•	create tasks
	•	track progress
	•	update status (pending, in_progress, completed)
	•	reason about what’s left

This mirrors how humans work and makes agent behavior debuggable.

⸻

3️⃣ Virtual file system inside agent memory

Instead of bloating prompts:
	•	agents write intermediate results to files
	•	files persist across steps
	•	state stays compact and cheap

This is context offloading, not prompt stuffing.

⸻

4️⃣ Tool-driven state mutation

Tools are first-class citizens:
	•	tools can read/write TODOs
	•	tools can read/write files
	•	tools can return Commands to mutate state

State changes are explicit and auditable.

⸻

5️⃣ Sub-agents and composition

Agents can:
	•	delegate work
	•	call other agents
	•	merge results back into shared state

This sets the foundation for multi-agent systems.

🧠 Design philosophy

Agents are not magic.
They are state machines powered by language models.

This repo treats agents as:
	•	deterministic systems with explicit transitions
	•	inspectable graphs, not loops
	•	evolving state, not stateless chats

⸻

👀 Who this repo is for

This repo is ideal if you are:
	•	learning LangGraph deeply
	•	building custom agent frameworks
	•	experimenting with agent memory and planning
	•	preparing for AI / LLM / agent interviews
	•	tired of black-box “agent wrappers”

This is not a beginner chatbot tutorial.

⸻

🚧 Status

This is an active learning and experimentation repo.

Planned explorations:
	•	persistent state with checkpointers
	•	human-in-the-loop nodes
	•	failure recovery and retries
	•	parallel node execution
	•	richer multi-agent coordination

Breaking changes are expected.

⭐ If this repo helps you

If this repo helped you:
	•	understand agents better
	•	debug LangGraph concepts
	•	think more clearly about agent design

Give it a ⭐ and build something weird with it.

That’s the goal.
	•	add badges (LangGraph, LangChain, Anthropic)

Just tell me.
